Problem:
- The dune length and height depends on the selected filter length.
  In particular large dunes that are overlapped with small dunes will be split.
  This will also affect standard errors, as splittin increases the number of dunes.
	-> standard error should better be calculated from length
- The error is not normally distributed. Often the standard error is about the
  same magnitude as the dune length, but there are no dunes of negative length
  or height.
- Fourier transform does not allow to nicely locate the peak.
- wavelet transform and than track maximum power


- combination of dunes:
	- if the amplitude of the combined dune is larger
	- constant mean: problem on hill slope
	- constant slope: problem on hill top
	- if the amplitude of the combined dune

- use second derivative (and compare)

- rule for merging
	min_in_between < 1/4(max_right + max_left)	problem at hill peak
	(d1*d2)/(l1*l2) > (d/l)

- alternative splitting rule:
	recursively use otsu's method
